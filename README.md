# CNN-MOT
The goal of this project is to implement a multiple object tracker algorithm for computer vision applications. It is a work in progress however a detection algorithm using a pre-trained Yolo v3 model is available. It is based on the following tutorial: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-perform-object-detection-with-yolov3-in-keras/.

## Installation
The project is written in Python (v3.6). You can install it by running `pip` in the root folder of the project

```bash
    pip install .
```

## Usage
To get a demo of the detection, a Jupyter notebook `yolov3_object_detection_colab_example` located in the notebook folder of the project is available.

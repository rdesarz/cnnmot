# Multiple object tracking project
This repository implements a multiple object tracker based on different algorithms. This is a work in progress. The first step is to try several detections technique such as using CNN for object detection.
## Example
This project contains an object detection based on Yolo v3 network mainly based on this link: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-perform-object-detection-with-yolov3-in-keras/. A notebook explains the steps required to try it on an random image.
